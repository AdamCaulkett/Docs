# Docs Partner Training resources

This subdirectory contains links and resources for training those who wish to contribute to [docs.microsoft.com](docs.microsoft.com]. In general, the most effective method for training partners is

1. Set up a block of time (typically an hour) a week in adfvance to provide training for the contributors
1. Send and introductory email to the contributors with a link to the [contributor's guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/tree/master/ContributorGuide), and ask that they preform the [tools and setup steps](https://github.com/Microsoft/Docs/blob/master/ContributorGuide/tools-and-setup.md) prior to the training. For those who are entierly new to Git and Github, you may also suggest then take online training prior to the session:
   * The [Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) course from [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com)
   * The [Try Git](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git] course from [https://www.codeschool.com](Code School)
   * [GitHub's 15-minue interactive primer](https://try.github.io/), [cheat sheets](https://training.github.com/kit/), and [links to formalized training](https://services.github.com/).  
1. Use the firth third of your training session explaing Git and Github using the [training PowerPoint Presentation](git-github-workflow-training.pptx).
1. Use the second third of the training session to demostrate our workflow using Git Bash, a markdown editor, and Github, and insist that the trainees follow along using their own tools.
1. Leave the final third of the training session for questions (of which there will be many).
1. Follow up after the trasining to let the partners know that they can reply on you as a git/github/workflow SME.
1. Actively seek out opportunities for the partners to make small changes and contributions to the documentation.
